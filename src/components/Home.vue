        The Ethereum Foundationâ€™s mission is to promote and support Ethereum platform and base
        layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools
        to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized
        applications (dapps), and together build a more globally accessible, more free and
        more trustworthy Internet.

        At the EF mainly focused on fundamental research, development of new Ethereum clients, Smart contract languages
        and the necessary tooling for dapp developers. Part of the job is advocating for the decentralized technology
        outside of the blockchain community to help to bridge the adoption gap. We also organize an annual developer
        focused conference called the Ethereum Devcon.
